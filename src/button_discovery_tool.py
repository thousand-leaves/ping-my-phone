Button Discovery & Configuration Tool
====================================

A tool to discover and configure your specific RF button code.
Run this once to find your button, then it updates your main app configuration.

What are button codes?
- Button codes are the actual RF signal codes transmitted by your RF button
- Each button sends a unique RF code (e.g., 6965825)
- Different RF devices send different codes (neighbor's garage door might be a different code)
- Your button's code is its unique "fingerprint" in the RF spectrum

Usage:
1. Run this tool
2. Press your RF button several times
3. Tool identifies your button code and updates configuration
4. Main app will then monitor only your button
